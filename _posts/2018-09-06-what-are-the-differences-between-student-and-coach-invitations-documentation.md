While most members will join the EduGuide site as members of a team, the method they use to join will be different based on their intended site role. This article will describe the different roles on EduGuide.org and the steps that should be followed when joining the site.
<h2>Site Roles</h2>
Members on EduGuide are separated into four main groups: members, restricted members, and IT Testers.
<ul>
 	<li>Members include all members of the site whether they belong to a team or not.</li>
 	<li>IT Testers are technicians who were asked to run a check of the EduGuide website from inside their school building using student hardware.</li>
 	<li>Restricted members are members of a team who are blocked from viewing key parts of the team such as the dashboard, goals, team library, metrics, member management, group management, and coach management. This designation is usually used for the students who join the site.</li>
</ul>
Within the team, members are broken up into the designation of member and coach. Members are able to view and interact with all other members inside team pages such as the dashboard and the team library. Coaches serve as leaders and moderators, and are given access to moderation tools.

Within the Coach role, there are three levels:
<ul>
 	<li>Admin Coach</li>
 	<li>Lead Coach</li>
 	<li>Support Coach</li>
</ul>
Access to moderation tools is granted based on the coach level. Admin coaches have the greatest ability, including configuration of the team, adding or removing members, and the creation and management of team groups.

IT Testers, typically technicians who assist with the launch of the EduGuide site for a school or district, can be invited from the Team Setup page, but are associated with the school’s team without joining. Instead, they join a separate IT testing team on the site where they complete a specific testing path.
<h2>Inviting Coaches</h2>
There is a section of the Team Setup page where Admin Coaches can send join invitations to coaches via email. In this section, they would enter the coach’s email address and role. The invited coach would then receive an invitation introducing them to EduGuide and asking them to join as a coach by clicking on a link. This link is associated specifically with their email address, and should not be shared.

It is important to keep in mind that an invitation that is sent to a coach grants them permission to create an account, and matches them to their team. Additionally, a group is automatically created for lead coaches as they join the team. Email addresses that are sent invitations continue to be listed on the Team Setup page as pending until they are accepted.
<h2>Inviting Students</h2>
Students may be directed to join the team using the join codes and URLs that are generated for each group. This information can be found by clicking on “Add Students” next to a given group. You will be taken to a second page where the groupo’s join code and URL are shown. A third option allows you to navigate to another page where you are able to add existing students to the group.

In your Team Library, there is a PDF copy of a handout with instructions on how to join the team which you can fill out with the join code information, photocopy, and then distribute to students.

When students join using the join code or URL, they will be allowed to create an account, added to their team, and added to a group. Group join codes can be used more than once.
<h2>Sending IT Tests to Technology Staff</h2>
IT Testing can be requested throughout the year, although it is typically conducted prior to the launch of a new team, or before the relaunch of a pre-existing team. IT Testing requests are sent from inside a section of the Team Setup page, which is only accessible to Admin Coaches.
