# EduGuide Insider

## Joining the Team

Note:

Hi, this is Nicole Chickering, Results Coach for EduGuide. In this episode of EduGuide Insider, I’m going to be talking about the different roles that are on the site and the process that coaches and students should follow when they join the team.

## Member Roles
<ul>
 	<li>Students</li>
 	<li>Coaches</li>
 	<li>Members</li>
 	<li>IT Testers</li>
</ul>
Note:

On the EduGuide website, there are four member roles: students, coaches, members, and IT Testers. Student and coach roles are typically used on school based teams, with teacher joining as coaches. IT Testers are typically the member of a technology staff for a school who completes IT testing before students are added to the team. And, a team member is anybody who has access to the team but does not serve the role of moderator. This role is typically used on professional development or non-school teams.

## Inviting Members to the Team

Note:

So, the process for joining the site changes depending on the role that you are joining under. I’m going to walk you through the steps for each role, starting with students.

## Inviting Students

Note:

The student role is the only one that does not join from an emailed invitation. Instead, students should be provided with a group join code. The join code can be found inside the group management area of your team.

Note:

To locate the join code for the group you want to add students to, you would locate the group on your team’s group management page, and then click “Invite Members.” You are taken to a page which displays that group’s join code information.

Note:

On the group’s invitation page, you have the choice of copying a join code or a join URL to your clipboard. Or, you can click “View List” to add existing team members to the group.

Note:

There is a handout in your team’s library which contains easy to follow steps which students can use while they are joining the site. There is space provided on the handout where you can write down a join code. You can photo copy the handout and then distribute it to students.

<hr />

## Inviting Coaches

Note:

Coaches can be invited to join the team from a section in the Team Setup page, which is accessible to only Admin Coaches.

<hr />

Note:

In this process, the team’s Admin Coaches would enter the email address and the preferred coach role for each person they want to add to the team in the Invite Coaches section of the team setup page. The team invites that they trigger will contain information about EduGuide and a link which the recipient can click to accept the coach invitation.

<hr />

## Joining the Team

Note:

Once the coach has accepted the invitation, they will prompted to create an account. Admin coaches are next taken to the team setup page where they can review the team’s settings. Lead and Support coaches are taken directly into their professional development path.

If the auto groups feature is turned on, a group is automatically created for lead coaches as they join the team. Groups can be managed from the Group management page inside the team.

<hr />

## IT Testing

Note:

Admin coaches are encouraged to use the IT Testing section in the team setup page to send an IT testing request to a member of their technology team. During testing, the technician will be walked through some configuration checks and then taken through a test version of the path. This allows us to catch any critical issues before students begin using the path system, ensuring a smooth user experience.
