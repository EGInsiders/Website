# EduGuide Insider

## Joining the Team

Note:

Hi, this is Nicole Chickering, Results Coach for EduGuide. In this episode of EduGuide Insider, I'm going to be talking about the different roles that are on the site and the process that coaches and students should follow when they join the team.

## Site Roles

Note:

So, the process for joining the site changes depending on the role that you are joining under. I'm going to walk you through the steps for each role, starting with students.

## Adding Students

Note:

The student role is the only one that does not join from an emailed invitation. Instead, students should be provided with a group join code. The join code can be found inside the group management area of your team.

Note:

To locate the join code for the group you want to add students to, you would locate the group on your team's group management page, and then click "Invite Members." You are taken to a page which displays that groupâ€™s join code information.

Note:

On the group's invitation page, you have the choice of copying a join code or a join URL to your clipboard. Or, you can click "View List" to add existing team members to the group.

Note:

There is a handout in your team's library which contains easy to follow steps which students can use while they are joining the site. There is space provided on the handout where you can write down a join code. You can photo copy the handout and then distribute it to students.
