<p># Setting up your EduGuide Team</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hi My name is Jon Morgan, Web Services Manager for EduGuide.</p>
<p>(and) I am Nicole Chickering, Results Coach.</p>
<p>In this video, we are going to be talking about the steps that Admin Coaches should expect to complete as they are setting up their team and preparing it for a launch with teachers and students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>---</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="http://eginsider.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/null.png" width="624" height="333" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are the primary contact for your organization, you will receive a message like this one asking you to join the site and begin planning for implementation. Click “Launch Team” to begin customization of your team.</p>
<p></p>
<p>---</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="http://eginsider.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/null-1.png" width="624" height="314" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>A page will open to ask if you already have an account, or if you need to create a new one. Clicking “No, Join” will take you to a registration form where you can start a new account.
</p>
<p>---</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="http://eginsider.gazerbeam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/null-2.png" width="624" height="414" alt="" title=""></p>
<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Create a new account by filling in all of the fields on the registration form and then clicking “join.” Your account will be created, and you will be automatically added to your team as a coach.</p>
<p></p>
<p>---</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your team’s setup page is divided into 8 steps which need to be completed before your team can be considered to be ready for launch. All admin coaches are able to access the setup page from the main navigation menu, and will be automatically taken here until all of the steps have been marked done. So, if there is a piece of information that you are missing, or information that you would like your colleague to provide, you can move on temporarily by skipping that step.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In your first step, you will send out a request asking a technician or an individual who supports your district’s technology to run a brief IT Test. During the IT Testing process, they will be taken through a survey and then a brief test path. This test is designed to ensure that students and teachers will have a smooth experience as they are completing path activities.

<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, you will want to choose whether or not to enable Autogroups. When the autogroups feature is “on,” a group is created automatically for each lead coach as they join your team. If you prefer to manually create all groups and then assign them to specific coaches, you can turn this feature off.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>## Team Captain</p>
<p></p>
<p>The admin coach who guides continuous program improvement by supporting all other coaches. A trusted leader who can invest in helping others succeed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, you will invite a member of your staff to join the team as a Captain. A team captain is someone who has the same capabilities as an admin coach, but they fill more of a leadership role, supporting the other coaches.</p>
